BARBARIA - A simple action RPG, with brutal combat

Made with the help of Unity RPG Tutorial #1 - Setting Up The Basics and later ones in the series, by gamesplusjames on youtube.
#####################
Controls
WSAD or arrowkeys = move character
G - attack

#####################
Issues
-Player death and reloading is handled in SlimeController. Mega awful, refactor this
-Floating numbers Text is too big
-Floating numbers show up even if invincibility frames are on [but no damage dealt luckily]

#####################
TODO
-to go from real time action rpg to more tactical action rpg, you can add tiles to act as pathfinding waypoints, and add pause [with spacebar or something], which will be a bit like Rimworld. This way you'll have the best of both worlds

-Add 3rd area [to the west], where Slimes live

-When you come close to a quest giver, he gives you the quest first [without pressing Space or anything] and only then will he start his dialogue. Should be the other way around

#####################
